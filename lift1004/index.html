            <h2>1. What did you learn?</h2>
            <p>We are all responsible for Reconciliation and are each on our own path. I was reminded of many things I had become familiar with through past learning: the establishment of treaties, the pass system, residential schools, the Truth and Reconciliation Report, etc. I was reminded of all of the ways in which colonization caused harm to Indigenous people.</p>
            <p>Something new I learned was the significance behind the Wampum Belt. I am greatly moved by the amount of work put into and deep meaning behind the belts.</p>

        <div id="q2">
            <h2>2. What do you still need to learn?</h2>
            <p>I know that I have a long way to go in my own path to Reconciliation. I will strive to integrate Indigenous ways of learning into my curriculum.</p>
            <p>Incorporating authentic Indigenous content into assessments is still something I struggle with. I am on a mission to find similar programs and other instructors that have been successful in integrating meaningful Indigenous content into their curriculum and assessments.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q3">
            <h2>3. How will you apply your learning?</h2>
            <p>Our program is working on integrating Indigenous perspectives into our courses. Establishing connections with Elders and relevant professionals, and working to make partnerships with Indigenous groups will get us on a better path.</p>
            <p>I will continue to share regular land acknowledgements in my courses, striving to incorporate my own commitments along with practical actions for students to take.</p>

            <h2>Info</h2>
            <p>I created this digital collage of photos I've taken, digitally altered with Photoshop, and combined with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The photos represent places where I am reminded of the TRC and how important it is for us to be present in the world.</p>
