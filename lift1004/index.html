            <h2>1. What did you learn?</h2>
            <p>We are all responsible for Reconciliation and are all on our own path. I was reminded of many things I already knew: treaties, the pass system, residential schools, the Truth and Reconciliation Report, etc. I was reminded of all the terrible things that have been done to Indiginous people.</p>
            <p>Something new I learned was the significance behind the Wampum Belt. I am greatly moved by the amount of work put into and deep meaning behind the belts.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q2">
            <h2>2. What do you still need to learn?</h2>
            <p>I know that I have a long way to go in my own path to Reconciliation. I need to do more and strive to integrate Indigenous ways of learning into my curriculum.</p>
            <p>Adding authentic indiginous content into assessments is still something I struggle with. I am on a missing to find similar programs and other instructors that have been successful in integrating <strong>meaningful</strong> indigenous content into their curriculum.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q3">
            <h2>3. How will you apply your learning?</h2>
            <p>Our program is working on integrating indigenous perspectives into our courses. Finding Elders, relevant professionals, and working to make partnerships with indigenous groups will get us on a better path.</p>
            <p>I will continue to work on my land acknowledgements, striving to have practical actions for students to take and not just pre-scripted words.</p>

            <h2>Info</h2>
            <p>I created this digital collage of photos I've taken, digitally altered with Photoshop, and combined with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The photos represent places where I am reminded of the TRC and how important it is for us to be present in the world.</p>
