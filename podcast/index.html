            It is important for students to hear from industry. 
            Guest lecturers can be great, but they eat a lot of time. 
            What if students got to listen to many industry professionals, 
            in shorter pre-recorded snippets, 
            then they could choose who they want to hear more from later?

        <p>That's what this is.</p>
