        <h1>SPSA Saskatoon Events</h1>
        <p>
            The events below come from the 
            <a href="https://spsa.ca/events/" target="blank">SPSA Event's page</a>
            under the Saskatoon Events accordion.
            But it takes several clicks to get there. Luckily their site runs on 
            <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>,
            which means it has a built in 
            <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/" target="_blank">REST API</a> 
            through <code>/wp-json/</code> endpoint.
            We can get their posts from <code>/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/</code> and 
            filter them using <code>?categories=15</code> 
            which returns only "Saskatoon Events".
