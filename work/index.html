        <h2>Work Integrated Learning</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Work-integrated learning is a form of curricular experiential education that formally integrates a
                student's academic studies with quality experiences within a workplace or practice setting. WIL
                experiences include an engaged partnership of at least: an academic institution, a host organization,
                and a student. WIL can occur at the course or program level and includes the development of student
                learning objectives and outcomes related to: employability, agency, knowledge and skill mobility and
                life-long learning.

                Polytechnics [...] offer a model that's built for this moment. They operate at the intersection of
                <strong>education and employment</strong>, where learning is hands-on, programs are co-designed with
                industry and graduates are job-ready from day one.
